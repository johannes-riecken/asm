Kaitai Struct: runtime library for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

1. Compile your .ksy file into .pm module. On Linux:

    % ksc -t perl my_module.ksy

On Windows:

    % kaitai-struct-compiler.bat -t perl my_module.ksy

2. Use the compiled .ksy in your program:

    use MyModule;

    # Instantiate from file
    $kaitai = MyModule->from_file("some_binary");
    
    # Instantiate from memory
    use IO::KaitaiStruct;
    $buf = "\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF";
    $kaitai = MyModule->new(
        IO::KaitaiStruct::Stream->new($buf)
    );

    # Extract data according to my_module.ksy
    $ship = $kaitai->ship();
    $helm = $ship->helm();
    $cargo = $ship->deck()->cargo();
